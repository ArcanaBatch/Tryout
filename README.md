#### Classification Algorithm Based on a BAyesian method for GEnomics

An application developed in Perl that allows the classification feature extraction and bootstrapping of genomic sequences, in order to improve data visualization and usefulness for genomic applications

The application is built from three standalone modules:
### Bayesian Classifier, Feature Extraction and Bootstrapping

*   The Bayesian Classifier, classifies new genomic sequences into predetermined classes using a training genome matrix of known parameters (e.g. disease, host´s age, host´s sex, geographic location, drug resistance etc.)
The Naive Bayes Classifier technique is based on the so-called Bayesian theorem and is particularly suited when the dimensionality of the inputs is high. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes can often outperform more sophisticated classification methods.
*   The Feature Extraction
